## Interview test
Build a simple front end that displays data for intersections, approaches and departures. Part One is building a dynamic table. Part Two is to create a visualization of the turn volume

Since during interviews I learned that Django framework was being used, I decided to learn and build the table using Django.

STEPS:

Install required packages by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" from terminal<br>
Type "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal and push enter<br>
Access the local host URL to see the table.<br>



**Features**<br>
-Clicking on any of the Intersection names will expand the table.<br>
-Clicking on '++' will either collapse the entire table, or expand the entire table.<br>
-Clicking on '+' will create a graph below the table, and clicking any of the other single '+' will overwrite the chart and create a new one.
